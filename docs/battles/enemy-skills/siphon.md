:::info
**Is Siphon considering taking damage?**

"Remove 1 HP" is not considered taking damage.

---

**Does Siphon effect units that are untargetable (e.g. Stealth)?**
Untargetable units are still effected. Siphon is not a targeting skill and Stealth just prevents you from being targeted, not from being affected by any skill.
