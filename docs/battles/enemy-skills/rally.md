**If a companion with the skill Rally is defeated, does it spawn an enemy?**

It will not deploy an enemy.

**If an enemy with Rally is killed during the enemy turn phase, does the newly spawned unit get to take a turn?**

The new enemy takes a turn if its timing hasn't passed yet. So if a level 20 brings in a level 10 but you're already past when level 10s would act, it doesn't get a turn that round. If the level 10s haven't taken turns yet, or you haven't moved on to level 5s yet, it would still get a turn that round.

**If an enemy is defeated but not removed (or is flipped to the other side), will Rally trigger? e.g. High Rock endgame**

The unit is defeated, and Rally triggers on defeat, so Rally still triggers even though the chip stays on the mat.
