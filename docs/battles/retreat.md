The [party](/docs/glossary/party) may agree to retreat at the end of any [round](/docs/battles/battle-round). If the party retreats, the encounter immediately ends. This can be helpful to save time and resources by preventing adventurers from likely defeat, but this means the encounter is failed, and the party does not gain the rewards for completing it.

The exception is in delve battles with the [Uncover](/docs/battles/objectives/uncover) objective, when the party must retreat after gaining the required [skyshards](/docs/battles/types/delve/skyshard) to succeed.

**Do I need to occupy the entrance tile to retreat?**

No, there is no requirement to be on the entrance tile. You may simply choose to retreat at the end of a round.
