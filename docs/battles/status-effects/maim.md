When this unit rolls Combat skill dice, the total damage rolled is reduced by half, then [rounded](/docs/glossary/rounding) down. This effect does not apply to [true damage](/docs/glossary/true-damage).

:::info
**Is damage rounded down per die or cumulative total of all damage dealt by Combat dice?**

The damage is reduced for the total amount of damage rolled. You sum the value of all rolled Combat dice and reduced by half (rounded down).

**How does Maim interact with rolling Combat dice in [<img src="/icons/defensive.svg" alt="Defensive Icon" className="icon-svg" />](/docs/battles/battle-forms/defensive) battle form?**

Maim only interacts with damage dealt, so you may still freely roll Combat dice and place them in [active slots](/docs/glossary/active-slot).
