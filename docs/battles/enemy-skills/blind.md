**How does Blind effect enemy targeting?**

When an enemy has the Blind status effect on them, they use their movement to get adjacent to the closest opposing unit (which is all other units) and then attack that unit. For ties, it prioritizes strongest. Even if its chip shows multiple targets, while blind it has only one target.
