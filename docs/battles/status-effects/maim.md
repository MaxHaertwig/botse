When this unit rolls Combat skill dice, the total damage rolled is reduced by half, then [rounded](/docs/glossary/rounding) down. This effect does not apply to [true damage](/docs/glossary/true-damage).

:::info
**Is damage rounded down per die or cumulative total of all damage dealt by Combat dice?**

The damage is reduced for the total amount of damage rolled. You sum the value of all rolled Combat dice and reduced by half (rounded down).

---

**If a unit rolls 1 damage on it's Combat skill dice, how much damage does it deal?**

The 1 is halved to 0.5, which rounded down is 0. Therefore, the unit will deal 0 damage.

---

**How does Maim interact with rolling Combat dice in [<img src="/icons/defensive.svg" alt="Defensive Icon" className="icon-svg" />](/docs/battles/battle-forms/defensive) battle form?**

Maim only interacts with damage dealt, so you may still freely roll Combat dice and place them in [active slots](/docs/glossary/active-slot).

---

**If an adventurer with Maim rolls skill dice alongside Combat dice is the damage of these skill dice also reduced by half?**

Only the damage dealt by Combat dice is halved, all other damage is unaffected.
