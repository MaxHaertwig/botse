**Recover Dice section in rulebook (pg. 23) re: drained dice**

This section says that you can recover drained dice during the Adventurers Rest step of the [End of Day Phase](/docs/campaign/day/end-of-day-phase).

This should instead say you recover drained dice during [End of Battle Cleanup](/docs/battles/end-of-battle). No drained dice recovery happens during Adventurers Rest step.
