:::warning[Errata]
**Endgame Day 1 - Breton Marauder should be Wood Elf**

In Encounter Setup for Cyrodiil's Endgame Day 1, when you are told to deploy a level 5: Breton Marauder, you should instead deploy a level 5: Wood Elf Marauder.

The Breton cannot be used because it is on the backside of the level 1: Breton Bandit which is also used in this encounter. The Wood Elf is also what was intended for thematic purposes.

**Fort Warden - Should auto-succeed social check on day 1**

Fort Warden's [social check](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/social-checks) should be automatically successful on day 1.

The text for this [town](/docs/campaign/day/encounter-phase/town) should say "If the Daggerfall Covenant is dominant, or if it is day 1, this check is automatically successful." This matches the other starting towns in Cyrodiil with social checks.

The guilds that start you in Fort Warden are the [Mages Guild](/docs/campaign/guilds/mages-guild) (A01), [Undaunted](/docs/campaign/guilds/undaunted) (A20), and [Circle of Champions](/docs/campaign/guilds/circle-of-champions) (A33).

**Cyrodiil D04 (Mages Guild) - companions can't block enemies from spawning**

By normal rules, if an enemy would deploy to a numbered hex that is already occupied, you would skip that hex and deploy the enemy to the next numbered hex instead. However, in this quest step, it is meant to be stated that if a numbered hex is occupied/blocked, the enemy deploys to the closest unoccupied hex.

With so few numbered hexes on this map (4 as opposed to the normal 8), it's is not intended that you can just block those hexes to avoid the enemies deploying altogether.
